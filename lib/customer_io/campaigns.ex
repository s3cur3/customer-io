  Get link metrics for an action

  Returns link click metrics for an individual action. Unless you specify otherwise, the response contains data for the maximum period by days (45 days).

  ## Options

    * `period`: The unit of time for your report.

  Get campaign journey metrics

  Returns a list of Journey Metrics for your campaign. These metrics show how many people triggered your campaign, were messaged, etc for the time period and "resolution" you set. You must provide the `start`, `end`, and `resolution` parameters or your request will return `400`.

  Metrics in the response are arrays, and each index in the array corresponds to the `resolution` in your request. If you request metrics in `days`, the first result in each metric array is the first day of results and each successive increment represents another day. 

  Each increment represents the number of journeys that started within a time period and eventually achieved a particular metric. For example, array index 0 for the `converted` metric represents the number of journeys that started on the first day/month of results that achieved a conversion.


  ## Options

    * `start`: The unix timestamp for the beginning of your journey metrics report.
    * `end`: The unix timestamp for the end of your journey metrics report.
    * `resolution`: Determines increment for journey metricsâ€”hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly.
